# small-economy

A simulation of the "random exchange model" written using [Elm Playground](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-playground/latest/)

Everyones starts with a fixed amount of wealth W.  
At each tick of the clock, two players are selected at random.  
The first transfers a fixed amount T of wealth to the second.

- What happens in the long run? Note that all players play under the same rules?

- What happens if a tax is imposed at regular intervals and the tax revenue 
is divided equally and distributed to all players? (a sort of universal basic income, or social security ...)

Here is a short [article](https://scripta.io/s/jxxcarlson:wealth-and-the-random-exchange-model) on this subject.
